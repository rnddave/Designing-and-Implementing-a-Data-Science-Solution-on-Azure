This is because our previous test set was quite small, and thus not a very good representation of 'real world' data. By contrast, this unseen dataset is large and a much better representation of data we'll find outside of the lab. In essence, this shows us that part of performance difference we see between training and test is due to model overfitting, and part of the error is due to the test set not being perfect. In the next exercises, we'll explore the trade-off we have to make between training and test dataset sizes. \n",
